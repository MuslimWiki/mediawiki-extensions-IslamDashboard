## 3. Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Areas
1. **Widget State Management**
   - Mitigation: Implement proper state management
   - Validation: Unit tests for state transitions
   - Owner: [TBD]

2. **Security**
   - Mitigation: Security audit and fixes
   - Validation: Penetration testing
   - Owner: [TBD]

3. **Performance**
   - Mitigation: Implement caching and optimization
   - Validation: Load testing
   - Owner: [TBD]

## 4. Dependencies

### Internal
- MediaWiki 1.43+
- PHP 8.0+
- MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.3+

### External
- [List any external dependencies]

## 5. Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Sprint 1-2)
- [ ] 100% test coverage for core functionality
- [ ] No critical security issues
- [ ] Basic widget functionality working

### Phase 2 (Sprint 3-4)
- [ ] All API endpoints implemented and documented
- [ ] Performance metrics within targets
- [ ] 90% i18n coverage

### Phase 3 (Sprint 5-6)
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

- [ ] Successful user acceptance testing

## 6. Open Questions

1. What is the expected maximum number of widgets per dashboard?
2. Do we need to support widget communication?
3. What are the performance requirements for widget rendering?
4. What analytics do we need to track?
5. What are the backup and recovery requirements?

## 7. Next Steps

1. Review and refine this plan with the team
2. Break down tasks into smaller, manageable units
3. Set up tracking for implementation progress
4. Schedule regular reviews and adjustments
5. Begin implementation of Phase 1
