## Gap Analysis

### High Priority Gaps
1. **Widget System**
   - Missing: Advanced widget lifecycle management
   - Impact: Limits extensibility and customization

2. **Performance**
   - Missing: Comprehensive caching strategy
   - Impact: May affect user experience with slower load times

3. **Documentation**
   - Missing: Complete developer and user guides
   - Impact: Makes onboarding and maintenance more difficult

### Medium Priority Gaps
1. **Accessibility**
   - Missing: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Impact: May affect users with disabilities

2. **Security**
   - Missing: Comprehensive input validation
   - Impact: Potential security vulnerabilities

### Low Priority Gaps
1. **Internationalization**
   - Missing: Some translations
   - Impact: Limited localization support

## Compliance Score

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Core Functionality | 40% | Basic structure exists |
